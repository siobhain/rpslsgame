# RPSLSGame
RPSLSGame is a  Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Game by Siobhan O'Brien as part of PP2 for CI

#Introduction

As part of PP2 for CI I chose to create a RPSLS game.  The game starts when the user clicks on one of the hand icons/buttons.

##About RPS
Rock paper scissors is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V).

The game has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[4]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. The game spread from China while developing different variants in signs over time.

Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision.

## UX/UI Section
### Intention of this game, explain goal of game
### design choices font colors
In fact I decided for very simple lines in this game as i wanted to spend the majority of tiome and effort on the javascript side, originally I thought I would keep it very similar to Love Maths as I admired the graphics esp the 4 game buttons (+, -, *, ?) bring in circular format godd color etc.

systems test - evaluate the entire application
regression test - rerun non functional test, like when new functionality added it caused side effects and broke something else  
consider person looking at this after u ahs no idea baout the applicaiton


No value to be gained by adding a navbar so decided not to include, I have on the advice of my mentor included a footer which contains social media icons and the line that the game is for educational purposes.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
